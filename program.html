        <h1>Lightbox Gallery Program 2019-2022</h1>
        <p>From November 2014-May 2019 the Lightbox was co-run by the Division of Academic and Public Programs (DAPP) and the department of Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technology (DIET). During that time we hosted nearly 80 projects and activities. These included <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5790/jace-clayton-the-great-salt">art installations</a>, <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/calendar/what-is-to-be-undone-modernism-in-the-21st-century">artist talks</a>, student projects, and <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5478/animationstudio">Harvard classes</a>. We focused primarily on using the Lightbox for artist projects, and as a room to feature class projects and digital scholarship. We did not host many collections data driven projects or projects exploring experimental and emerging technologies. Starting August 2019 DIET will take full ownership of the Lightbox Gallery and program it for two years with projects that focus on data, experimental technology, and the issues that lie within. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Our primary goals are to… </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus on projects that integrate our collections data; push the capabilities of our API; and show new ways of thinking about, interrogating, and presenting collections</li>
          <li>Explore new visual metaphors that express the complex dimensionality of objects and collections (i.e. collections as <a href="https://vimeo.com/103183403">solar systems</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/336097925">forests</a>)</li>
          <li>Explore new modes of interaction (i.e. voice control, gesture control, <a href="https://vimeo.com/154085159">remote control</a>)</li>
          <li>Explore current topics that are not present in our exhibitions, publications, and galleries (i.e. AI and ethics; interaction and games)</li>
          <li>Focus on interactive narratives and exploration over slideshows and videos</li>
          <li>Minimize the impact on other departments at the museum</li>
          <li>Partner with faculty and local educators to develop a class that integrates the Lightbox Gallery</li>
          <li>Look for projects that incorporate the unique characteristics of the Lightbox Gallery (i.e. the bright and changing sun light).</li>          
        </ul>
        
        <hr>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>The program will follow the structure of the academic year. Each year will have a broad theme. Projects are expected to represent the theme and address issues within the theme. Each year will be divided into two periods of Standard Programming and two periods of Lightbox Lab.</p>
        <h3>Standard Programming</h3>
        <p>Full semesters will be given to collaborators that we find via an RFP process or to those that will use the Lightbox in conjunction with a class. Collaborators have the flexibility to divide up the time as they see fit as long as their projects align with the requirements we agree upon upfront. We may take back control of the space for short periods of time during this semester (e.g. during the Cambridge Science Festival). These disruptions will be negotiated and scheduled with the collaborator before the semester begins. </p>
        <h3>Lightbox Lab</h3>
        <p>J-term and Summer Session will be the time to run more experimental and scrappier projects as part of a program called Lightbox Lab. The only video wall we have is the Lightbox so it is difficult to test new ideas over an extended period of time. We will use these sessions as a time to break from our regular programming. We’ll use the time to explore and learn; invite colleagues to play and engage with the space; and test ideas for future projects. We will keep the space open to the public so that visitors can participate in the research and experimentation. </p>

        <h2>Regulations and Project Proposals</h2>
        <p>Certain constraints apply to the physical space of the Lightbox. If you intend to bring any additional equipment or components in to the Lightbox, it would be useful to draw out the Lightbox <a href="index#floorplan">Gallery floorplan</a> where you intend to place each object, its measurements and materials, how you intend to mount or affix it, where cords and other components will lead, and any other relevant details. Please bring this to any proposal and project review meetings. </p>
        <p>Please note the following while planning your project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Waivers are required for bringing art components in and out of the gallery and building.</li>
          <li>Any materials brought into the space (e.g., fabric screens) need to be fire rated.</li>
          <li>Cords cannot be in the path to the exits. Cords elsewhere on the floor must be taped down. Additionally, to comply with ADA guidelines as well as saftey regulations, cords cannot be placed in walkways or areas.</li>
        </ul>
